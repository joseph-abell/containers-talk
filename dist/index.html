					<h1>Containers</h1>
					<p>From the point of an app developer</p>
					<p>https://containers-talk.netlify.app</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>What we'll discuss</h2>

					<p>It's a Matryoshka Doll</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Your App</li>
						<li>Docker Containers</li>
						<li>Docker Compose</li>
						<li>Kubernetes</li>
						<li>Pods</li>
						<li>Services</li>
						<li>Deployments</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Your App</h2>
					<p>The simplest way for you to get code that works on more than your machine alone, is to abstract away the hardware.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Docker Containers</h2>
					<p>They act as an extraction between the application and the server</p>
					<ul>
						<li>You get a stripped down operating system</li>
						<li>You install any extras you need</li>
						<li>You run your app</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Docker Compose</h2>
					<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
						<p>A way to work with multiple docker containers on one machine</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Allows you to set up containers that need to interact to provide a service</li>
							<li>Allows containers to talk to each other by setting up interconnected ports</li>
							<li>Lets you describe what you want, rather than how to make what you want.
								<ul>
									<li>Easier to reason about</li>
									<li>Easier to replicate</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</section>

					<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
					<p>A way to work with multiple docker containers on <b>multiple</b> machines</p>
					<ul>
						<li>More resilient to errors</li>
						<li>Platform agnostic</li>
						<li>Allows a user to take their setup and move to a different provider</li>
						<li>Can be run locally, on premises or on a cloud provider</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Pod</h2>
					<div style="font-size: 0.8em;">
					<p>Your container, with some extra metadata. Kubernetes uses this metadata to keep your app stable.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Pods are created to meet demand of your app</li>
						<li>Pods are killed when there is a fault with a container.</li>
						<li>Treat as ephemeral</li>
						<li>You can have more than one container to a pod, just be aware that anything in a pod will scale together.</li>
						<li>Pods will only be available when all containers inside them are marked as healthy</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Service</h2>
					<p>How you connect to containers in a stable manner.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>They provide a name and ip address which will never change</li>
						<li>They will keep a list of the relevant pods, and will direct traffic to pods when they are healthy.</li>
						<li>If a pod reports as unhealthy, they are removed from the list and an identical pod is created.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Deployments</h2>
					<p>Help you make rolling deployments, where pods are replaced one by one. Treats rollbacks in the same manner.</p>
				</section>
